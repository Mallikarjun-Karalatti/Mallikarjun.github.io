    <p>Mozilla is a free software community founded in 1998 by members of Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open standards, with only minor exceptions.The community is supported institutionally by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation</p>
    <p>In 2020 Mozilla announced it would be cutting off 25% of its worldwide staff of nearly 1,000 to reduce costs; at United States Federal minimum wage full-time, this would reduce costs by $3.8m, while at an average pay of $50k/year this would represent a $12.5M cost reduction. Firefox has fallen from 30% market share to 4% in 10 years. Despite this, executive pay increased 400%, with Mitchell Baker, Mozilla’s top executive, being paid $2.4m in 2018. In December 2020, Mozilla closed its Mountain View office</p>
